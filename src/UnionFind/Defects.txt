*Quick-Find Defect
1. Union is too expensive. (N number of array accesses)
2. Trees of this algorithm are flat, but it is too expensive to keep them flat since it takes N2 array accesses to process a sequence of N union commands on N number of objects.

*Quick Union Defect
1. Unlike in Quick Find, the trees of this one can get tall since nodes are connected via the root node.
2. Still, the find is too expensive because it can be N number of array accesses.
